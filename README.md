## Hey! I'm Dami! 👋 👨‍💻 👨‍🏫 👨‍🎓

I'm a full stack JavaScript web developer based in Curitiba, Brazil.

### What I wake up every day for

My daily goals are usually one of these:
- Find a new problem that needs to be solved;
- Detect companies' workflows that could be improved with a little help from technology;
- Discover out new subjects to learn;
- Master a subject to teach others (mainly for free on a portal I've been working on).
